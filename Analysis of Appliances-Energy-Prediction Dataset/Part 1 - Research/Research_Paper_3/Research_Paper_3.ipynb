But the prediction of energy consumption in housing is very dependent on consumers behavior, so the author suggests a method that takes into consideration the usage of hourly base of each appliance and then combine the usage to calculate the total consumption. It is based on the segmentation of data considering the patterns in energy consumption. The historical data is divided according to the results of the k-means clustering algorithm. This procedure improves the precision of the predictor.\n",
