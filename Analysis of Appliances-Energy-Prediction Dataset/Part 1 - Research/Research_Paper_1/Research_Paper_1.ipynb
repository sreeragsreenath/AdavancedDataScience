    "### Discussion of Results\n",
    "The consumption of appliances represents thehighest percentage of electrical consumption, between 70% and 79%of the monthly consumption. The appliances’ consumption profileis highly variable as seen in Fig. 7, with periods of almost constantdemand followed by high spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing the exploratory data analysis some paired corre-lations found were interesting. Fig. 9, Appendices A and B showthat high correlations exist between T1 and T2 (0.84), T2 andT3 (0.74), T4 and T5 (0.87), T5 and T6 (0.63), T7 and T8 (0.88),and T8 with T9 (0.86). This is important because it indicates thatRC thermal networks are suited for building energy modelingand that measuring the most representative rooms may be rep-resentative enough for the energy prediction of appliances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships between the humidity in each room and theappliances’ consumption are quite telling. From research in [43],the humidity of the room (also the humidity ratio) increased whenoccupants arrived in the office room and started to drop when theoffice was empty. Therefore, higher humidity may indicate occu-pancy.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "ConclusionThe statistical data analysis has shown thought-provokingresults in both the exploratory analysis and in prediction models. The pairwise plots are useful because they shed light on thedifferent relationships between parameters that could be hiddenin final predictive models. The GBM and RF models improve theRSME and R2of predictions compared to the SVM-radial and mul-tiple linear regression lm. For all the models, the time information(NSM) was ranked as the most important to predict the appliances’consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather data from the nearby weather station was shownto increase the prediction accuracy in the GBM models.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using all the predictors the light consumption wasranked highly. However, when studying different predictor subsets,removing the light consumption appeared not to have a significantimpact. This may be an indication that other features are correlatedwell with the light energy consumption."
